    <h1>What is  Speed Reading??</h1>
<p>In this day and age of information overload we need a new information processing skill, that is speed reading.Speed reading will be beneficial for you if you could just maintain the balance between speed and comprehension.
Reading is not simply reading books or articles, it inculcates creativity  and situational awareness.
To understand the importance of reading as an information processing skill we must understand what information overload is.
We are surrounded by sources of information in this digital age. All these social media applications are constantly feeding us new information.
This huge intake of information makes it difficult for our brain to understand what is important and what is not. Our brain has a tendency to forget unimportant information, so when a lot of information is supplied on a regular basis it often forgets most of the things including important details.
How do we solve this problem?</p>
<p>Well first try to cut unnecessary information intake and learn techniques that enhances
One of the most effective ways is by working on our reading skills and master  reading techniques.
The reading technique that we will be focusing on is called active recall technique and is very beneficial for students and professionals alike as they are involved in reading a lot of academic text.</p>

<p>Before we introduce you to this technique you should know some basic concepts regarding reading.</p>
<h2>1.Vocalization</h2>
	In this step you focus on reading the text aloud, pronouncing each word aloud to train your brain to easily identify every word and increase your vocabulary.This is a very beginner level reading that everyone is taught.

2.Subvocalization
	Subvocalization is reading in mind. It is the voice that you hear when you read in mind.
Subvocalization is developed naturally while reading to reduce cognitive load but if you read frequently it is not required as much you will focus on how to turn it off and on in order to tweak speed and comprehension maintaining a balance.

3.Minimizing subvocalization and scanning
Subvocalization is automatically done by mind to reduce what is called cognitive load by easily relating the meaning of the text. It is something that we develop naturally while we read. Subvocalization however limits your reading speed. A person's vocalization and subvocalization speed is the same.
But you may have noticed that you don't need to read everything word by word or character by character to understand it for example the year 1947 you don't need to read ‘nineteen hundred and forty seven’ to understand its the years 1947 ,you may do the same thing with common grammar, like articles and conjunctions and all the other words that you may be familiar with. You see, though subvocalization is helpful in understanding text easily it also limits the reader’s speed, so you only read at a speed that you usually talk at, i.e 150 to 200 wpm for people who read normally.
Subvocalization can’t be eliminated completely as it is naturally developed over time and is required in certain cases like memorizing and reading technical sections but it slows one down when reading simple text.



After getting a hang of how to minimize subvocalization, what you should focus on is active recall.It is a technique to really grasp what you are reading through.
Keep the following things in mind while you read:

1.Scan the text in your mind.
2.Subvocalize only the part that you think is difficult to understand. This text generally involves long and complex words which are generally present in technical documentation.
3.Pause and recall what you have read when you subvocalize part of text.
4.Think how it is connected with previous text.
5.Think where the text is going ahead. Means guess what will be the next part after this text.
This helps you connect what you have read with what you are about to read and you can avoid spacing out(don't you sometimes read a paragraph or sometimes even entire page and have no idea what you just read?It's quite annoying to reread things!
).

Once you get a hang of this technique it will help you quickly understand what you read and save a lot of your time.
